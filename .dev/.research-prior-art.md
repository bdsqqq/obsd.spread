# prior art research

## notebook navigator

**what it is:** full file explorer replacement (35k LOC, react + tanstack virtual)

**features relevant to spread:**
- 1-5 preview lines with optional HTML stripping
- thumbnails from featured images
- date grouping (today, yesterday, 7d, 30d, months)
- frontmatter support for note names/timestamps
- compact mode when previews disabled

**architecture:**
- react with tanstack virtual for 100k+ note performance
- dual-layer cache (IndexedDB + RAM)
- service architecture (MetadataService, ContentProviderRegistry)
- content provider pipeline for metadata

**why user finds it bloated:**
1. 35k lines of code for many features beyond file preview
2. replaces entire file explorer (not additive)
3. 1D stack layout only (no grid/masonry)
4. designed as standalone UI, not bases integration

**what to avoid:**
- scope creep — they built a full app, we want one feature
- react dependency — obsidian native is lighter
- replacing core obsidian features — we extend bases, not replace

**what to learn:**
- preview line count is configurable (1-5 lines) — good UX
- HTML stripping from previews — needed for markdown
- compact mode toggle — good for density control
- thumbnail extraction from frontmatter — could add later

## other relevant plugins

### datacards (sophokles187)
- transforms dataview tables into cards
- uses registerMarkdownCodeBlockProcessor
- presets: grid, portrait, kanban
- 126 stars — simpler scope

### grid-card-view (mafflerbach)
- extends BasesView directly
- adjustable card dimensions via sliders
- property grid layout option
- our implementation reference

### image-captions
- MutationObserver pattern for DOM injection
- good cleanup pattern with disconnect()

## differentiation for obsd.spread

| aspect | notebook navigator | obsd.spread |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| scope | full file explorer | bases view only |
| layout | 1D vertical list | 2D responsive grid |
| integration | replaces sidebar | extends bases |
| complexity | 35k LOC, react | <500 LOC, vanilla |
| approach | everything included | one thing well |

## implementation implications

1. **keep scope narrow**: text preview in bases cards, nothing else
2. **no react**: vanilla ts + obsidian apis
3. **configurable preview length**: steal the 1-5 lines idea
4. **HTML/markdown stripping**: extract plain text for preview
5. **grid layout**: what notebook navigator lacks
6. **minimal cache**: just read files, let obsidian cache

## potential enhancements (v2+)

- frontmatter property for custom preview field
- markdown rendering in preview (not just plain text)
- thumbnail extraction from first image in note
- compact mode toggle
